About myself
======

I am a computational and biophysical chemist based in the UK, passionate about rational drug design. My career has been focusing on computational tools to tackle real-world challenges in drug discovery industry. My expertise lies in structure-based drug design (SBDD) and computer-aided drug design (CADD), with a particular focus on novel chemical modalities for induced proximity.

I did chemistry PhD at the University of Bristol and MRes at Imperial College London, where I gained diverse experience across fields like synthetic medicinal chemistry, molecular modelling, quantum chemistry, and data science. I am skilled in techniques from physics-based simulations to machine learning statistics, to discover and develop potential drug candidates in silico.

In my current role as a CADD scientist in biotech, I've had the opportunity to develop softwares and build pipelines for different stages of the drug discovery process, including virtual screening and lead optimisations. I am always exploring new technologies like generative AI models and free energy calculations to explore chemical space and accelerate drug design efficiently. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary research and collaborate closely with medicinal chemists, structural biologists and DMPK experts in my daily work.

This blog is for sharing my insights into the world of molecular modelling and cheminformatics.
