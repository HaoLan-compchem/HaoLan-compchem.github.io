I am a computational and biophysical chemist based in the UK, passionate about rational drug design. My career has been focusing on computational tools to tackle real-world challenges in drug discovery industry. My expertise lies in structure-based drug design (SBDD) and computer-aided drug design (CADD), with a particular focus on novel chemical modalities for induced proximity.

I did a PhD at the University of Bristol and an MRes at Imperial College London, where I gained diverse experience across fields like medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, quantum chemistry, and data science. I am skilled in using a wide range of techniques, from physics-based simulations to machine learning statistics, to discover and develop potential drug candidates.

In my current role as a CADD scientist in biotech, I've had the opportunity to develop softwares and build pipelines for various stages of the drug discovery process, from virtual screening to lead optimisations. I am always exploring new technologies like generative AI models and free energy calculations to virtually explore chemical space and efficiently accelerate drug design. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary research and collaborate closely with medicinal chemists, structural biologists and DMPK experts in my daily work.

This blog is where I'll be sharing my journey and insights into the world of molecular modelling and cheminformatics.
