# Hello, I'm Hao Lan!

I am a computational and biophysical chemist based in the UK, passionate about accelerating drug discovery. My career has been focused on bridging the gap between academia and industry by using computational tools to tackle real-world challenges in drug design. My expertise lies in **structure-based drug discovery (SBDD)** and **computer-aided drug design (CADD)**, with a particular focus on novel chemical modalities for induced proximity.

I hold a PhD from the University of Bristol and an MRes from Imperial College London, where I gained diverse experience across fields like medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, quantum chemistry, and data science. I am skilled in using a wide range of techniques, from physics-based simulations to machine learning statistics, to discover and develop new drug candidates.

In my current role as a CADD scientist in biotech, I've had the opportunity to develop softwares and build pipelines for various stages of the drug discovery process, from virtual screening to lead optimization. I am always exploring new technologies like generative AI models and free energy calculations to virtually explore chemical space and speed up drug discovery process. I believe in the power of interdisciplinary research and collaborate closely with medicinal chemists and structural biologists in my daily work.

This blog is where I'll be sharing my journey and insights into the world of molecular modelling and cheminformatics.
